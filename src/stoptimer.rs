// Most of this module is now handled by RTIC's Monotonic timer.
// The original get_millis() and beat functions are removed as timing
// will be passed into methods that require it from the RTIC tasks.

// Placeholder if any utility functions are needed in the future,
// they would take time as an argument.
// For example:
// pub fn example_time_dependent_function(current_time_ms: u32, other_param: u16) -> u8 {
//     // ... logic using current_time_ms ...
//     0
// }
